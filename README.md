# jmoore.dev.2

Source code for my personal website, but "new" & "better"... maybe

### Stuff I plan to use with this

- **[Pug]** - My favourite templating language
- **[jQuery]** - Cry about it & suck my bytes.
- **[Tailwind]** - Some kind of CSS framework
- **[Svelte]** - Some kind of UI framework
- **[Express]** - Node web server. There may be more efficient alternatives but I really enjoy this one.
